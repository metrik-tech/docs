Please **do not** modify the source code of Metrik for your game. Instead, use its API to customize the behavior you want. Modifying the source code makes it much harder for you to receive feature updates.

There should be **no reason** to modify the source code of Metrik \(unless you are adding a brand new feature or fixing a bug\).
